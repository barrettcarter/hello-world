Repository about my channel
I am a PhD student in the Agricultural and Biological Engineering Department at the University of Florida.
I do research related to _in situ_ spectroscopy for water quality analysis.
So, this GitHub account will eventually include code for spectrophotometry setups, water quality data analysis, and hydrological modeling.
